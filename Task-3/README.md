# Netflix-Clone

Developed a simplified version of the Netflix streaming platform as a web application. The Netflix clone includes basic functionalities such as displaying a list of movies or series,providing details for selected titles, and simulating video playback. Designed the user interface to resemble the Netflix layout for an immersive user experience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
